# Segment Tree

# 📘 Introduction

A **Segment Tree** is a powerful tree‑based data structure used to efficiently answer **range queries** and handle **updates** on an array.

Unlike Fenwick Tree, Segment Tree supports:

* Range queries (sum / min / max / gcd)
* Point updates
* Range updates (with Lazy Propagation)

All major operations run in **O(log n)** time.

# 🧠 Core Idea

The array is recursively divided into segments.
Each node of the tree stores information about a **range (segment)** of the array.

Root → entire array
Children → left & right halves

For array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`

```
                       [1..6]
                   /               \
              [1..3]               [4..6]
            /        \            /        \
        [1..2]      [3]        [4..5]      [6]
       /      \                 /     \
    [1]      [2]             [4]     [5]
```

Each node stores information (sum / min / max) for its range.

# 🧮 Operations Supported

* Build Tree
* Range Query (sum / min / max)
* Point Update
* Range Update (Lazy Propagation)

All operations take **O(log n)** time.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class SegmentTree {
    vector<int> seg;
    int n;

public:
    SegmentTree(int n) {
        this->n = n;
        seg.assign(4 * n, 0);
    }

    void build(int idx, int low, int high, vector<int>& arr) {
        if (low == high) {
            seg[idx] = arr[low];
            return;
        }
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        build(2 * idx + 2, mid + 1, high, arr);
        seg[idx] = seg[2 * idx + 1] + seg[2 * idx + 2];
    }

    int query(int idx, int low, int high, int l, int r) {
        // No overlap
        if (r < low || high < l) return 0;

        // Total overlap
        if (l <= low && high <= r) return seg[idx];

        // Partial overlap
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        return query(2 * idx + 1, low, mid, l, r)
             + query(2 * idx + 2, mid + 1, high, l, r);
    }

    void update(int idx, int low, int high, int pos, int val) {
        if (low == high) {
            seg[idx] = val;
            return;
        }
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (pos <= mid)
            update(2 * idx + 1, low, mid, pos, val);
        else
            update(2 * idx + 2, mid + 1, high, pos, val);

        seg[idx] = seg[2 * idx + 1] + seg[2 * idx + 2];
    }
};

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    cin >> n;                 // size of array

    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];

    SegmentTree st(n);
    st.build(0, 0, n - 1, arr);

    int q;
    cin >> q;                 // number of queries

    /*
        Query types:
        1 l r  -> range sum query [l, r]
        2 pos val -> update arr[pos] = val
    */

    while (q--) {
        int type;
        cin >> type;

        if (type == 1) {
            int l, r;
            cin >> l >> r;
            cout << st.query(0, 0, n - 1, l, r) << "\n";
        }
        else if (type == 2) {
            int pos, val;
            cin >> pos >> val;
            st.update(0, 0, n - 1, pos, val);
        }
    }

    return 0;
